## Description

I fixed the code of this webpage to be more clear and specific, made the headings follow order of importance, and gave it a specific title.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency.
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards.
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes.

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order.
